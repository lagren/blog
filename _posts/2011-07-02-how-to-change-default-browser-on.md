title: How to change default browser on Samsung Galaxy Tab

I wanted to change the default browser on my Galaxy Tab to Firefox, but couldn't find a setting for it (in an intuitive 
way). So after some googling and trial and error, I found what I was looking for.

The solution: 

1. Programs
2. Settings
3. Applications
4. Administer programs
5. All
6. Select the current default browser
7. Clear standard

Note: The user interface on my tablet is in norwegian, so I had to translate the menu items into english. I think the 
translations should be close enough to get others on the right track.
